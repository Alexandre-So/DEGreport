\section{General QC figures from DE analysis}

We are going to do a differential expression analysis with edgeR/DESeq2.
We have an object that is comming from the edgeR package. 
It countains a gene count matrix
for 85 TSI HapMap individuals, and the gender information. With that, we are 
going to apply the `glmFit` function or `DESeq2` to get genes differentially expressed 
between males and females.

<<chunk-1>>=
des<-humanSexDEedgeR$design
fit <- glmFit(humanSexDEedgeR,des)
lrt <- glmLRT(fit)
tab<-cbind(lrt$table,p.adjust(lrt$table$PValue,method="BH"))
detags <- rownames(tab[tab[,5]<=0.1,])
plotSmear(humanSexDEedgeR, de.tags=detags)
@

We need to extract the experiment design data.frame where the condition is 
Male or Female.

<<chunk-2>>=
counts<-cpm(humanSexDEedgeR,log=FALSE)
design<-data.frame(condition=sub("1","Male",sub("0","Female",des[,2])), other=1, row.names=colnames(counts))
@

\subsection{Size factor QC}

A main assumption in library size factor calculation of edgeR and DESeq2 (and others)
is that the majority of genes remain unchanged. Plotting the distribution
of gene ratios between each gene and the average gene can show how true this is.
Not superuseful for many samples because the plot becomes crowed.

<<chunk-size-factor>>=
degCheckFactors(counts[,1:10])
@


\subsection{Mean-Variance QC plots}

p-value distribution gives an idea on how well you model is capturing the input data
and as well whether it could be some problem for some set of genes. In general,
you expect to have a flat distribution with peaks at 0 and 1. In this case, we add
the mean count information to check if any set of genes are enriched in any
specific p-value range.

Variation (dispersion) and average expresion relationship shouldn't be a factor among
the differentialy expressed genes. When plotting average mean and standard desviation,
significant genes should be randomly distributed.

In this case, it would be good to look at the ones that are totally outside the expected 
correlation.

You can put this tree plots together using \Rcode{degQC}.

<<chunk-qc>>=
degQC(lrt$table$PValue, counts, design$condition)
@


\subsection{Covariates effect on count data}

Another important analysis to do if you have covariates is to calculcate
the correlation between PCs from PCA analysis to different variables you may
think are affecting the gene expression. This is a toy example of how the
function works with raw data, where clearly library size correlates with 
some of the PCs.

<<chunk-covariates>>=
library(DESeq2)
idx <- c(1:5, 75:80)
dse <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(humanSexDEedgeR$counts[1:1000, idx],
                              humanSexDEedgeR$samples[idx,], 
                              design=~group)
resCov <- degCovariates(log2(counts(dse)+0.5),
<<<<<<< HEAD
                     colData(dse))
resCov$plot
@

=======
                        colData(dse))
resCov$plot
@


\subsection{Covariates correlation with metrics}

Also, the correlation among covariates and metrics from the analysis can
be tested. This is useful when the study has multiple variables, like in
clinical trials. The following code will return a correlation table, and
plot the correlation heatmap for all the covariates and metrics in a table.

<<chunk-cor-covariates>>=
cor <- degCorCov(colData(dse))
head(cor)

\section{Report from DESeq2 analysis}

Here, we show some useful plots for differentially expressed genes.

\subsection{Volcano plots}

Volcano plot using the output of DESeq2. It mainly needs data.frame with
two columns (logFC and pVal). Specific genes can be plot using the option
\Rcode{plot\_text} (subset of the previous data.frame with a 3rd column to be used
to plot the gene name).

<<deseq2-volcano>>=
dse <- DESeq(dse)
res <- results(dse)
res$id <- row.names(res)
show = as.data.frame(res[1:2, c("log2FoldChange", "padj", "id")])
degVolcano(as.data.frame(res[,c("log2FoldChange", "padj")]), plot_text = show)
@

\subsection{Gene plots}

Plot top genes coloring by group. Very useful for experiments with nested 
groups. `xs` can be `time` or `WT`/`KO`, and `group` can be `treated`/`untreated`.
Another classification can be added, like `batch` that will plot points 
with different shapes.

<<deseq2-gene-plots>>=
degPlot(dds=dse, res = res, n = 6, xs = "group")
@

Another option for plotting genes in a wide format:

<<deseq2-gene-plot-wide>>=
degPlotWide(dse, rownames(dse)[1:5], group="group")
@

\subsection{Full report}

If you have a DESeq2 object, you can use degResults to create a full report
with markdown code inserted,
including figures and tbale with top de-regulated genes, GO enrichment
analysis and heatmaps and PCA plots. If you set \Rcode{path\_results},
different files will be saved there.

<<deseq2>>=
resreport <- degResults(dds=dse, name="test", org=NULL,
                        do_go=FALSE, group="group", xs="group",
                        path_results = NULL)
@

\subsection{Interactive shiny-app}

Browsing gene expression can help to validate results or select some gene
for donwstream analysis. Run the fowlling lines if you want to visualize
your expression values by condition:

<<chunk-shiny, eval=FALSE>>=
degObj(counts,design,"degObj.rda")
library(shiny)
shiny::runGitHub("lpantano/shiny", subdir="expression")
@

\section{Detect patterns of expression}

In this section, we show how to detect pattern of expression. Mainly useful when
data is a time course experiment. \Rfunction{degPatterns} needs a expression
matrix, the design experiment and the column used to group samples.

<<pattern>>=
ma = assay(rlog(dse))[row.names(res)[1:100],]
res <- degPatterns(ma, as.data.frame(colData(dse)), time="group", col=NULL)
@

\section{Useful functions}

This section shows some useful functions during DEG analysis.

\Rfunction{degFilter} helps to filter genes with a minimum read count by group.

<<chunk-filter>>=
cat("gene in original count matrix: 1000")
filter_count <- degFilter(humanSexDEedgeR$counts[1:1000, idx],
                          humanSexDEedgeR$samples[idx,], "group",
                          min=1, minreads = 50)
cat("gene in final count matrix", nrow(filter_count))
@
