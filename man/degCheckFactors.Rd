\description{
Distribution of gene ratios used to calculate Size Factors.
}
\details{
This function will plot the gene ratios for each sample. To calculate
the ratios, it follows the simliar logic than DESeq2/edgeR uses, where the expression
of each gene is divided by the mean expression of that gene. The distribution
of the ratios should approximate to a normal shape and the factors should be similar
to the median of distributions. If some samples show different distribution,
the factor may be bias due to some biological or technical factor.
